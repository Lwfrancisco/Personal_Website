Add GitHub if at all possible. (use GitHub for your Senior Project)

There, I worked with and developed both application-level and embedded linux software for the latest fiber-optic sensing system technologies. I have experience working with both old code and developing new software to accelerate workflows and integrate hardware and software systems.

Eventually: Create a child theme using theme inheritance for everything you friggin modified so when you update the theme it doesn't blow everything up.
(Maybe back up current theme, and figure out how to do a git diff on all the files???)
Inexhaustive list:
    /quark/templates/partials/footer & logo
    /quark/images/logo folder
    quark.yaml
    custom.css (wherever it may be)


Perhaps github the inherited theme? Maybe that's all? Not sure lol.....

Fix menu icon on mobile.
