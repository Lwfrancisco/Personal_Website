#### Software Engineering Intern at NASA Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center

June 2015 – August 2015

<ul class="fancy-list">
    <li>Developed a data acquisition system for liquid metal strain gauges on flight-ready systems.</li>
    <li>Interfaced between a Raspberry Pi and some number of microcontrollers taking in sensor information.</li>
    <li>Implemented I2C communication and internet communication protocols to transmit data from source to desktop application.</li>
    <li>Desktop application developed using LabView.</li>
</ul>

June 2016 – August 2016
<ul class="fancy-list">
    <li>Ported 30-year-old undocumented single-threaded digital signal post-processing code into a highly parallel system designed to run in near real-time on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</li>
    <li>Programmed in CUDA C on the Jetson TX1 platform using ARM CPU cores paired with a power efficient Nvidia Maxwell GPU cores.</li>
    <li>Benchmarked and evaluated feasibility in comparison to ASIC and FPGA alternatives.</li>
</ul>

June 2017 – August 2017
<ul class="fancy-list">
    <li>Benchmarked additional ARM systems evaluating feasibility for micro-FOSS, a near real-time implementation of the Fiber Optic Sensing System (FOSS). </li>
    <li>Provided support and patching for the previously developed digital processing system.</li>
    <li>Acted as software consultant to and even oversaw a variety of other intern projects.</li>
</ul>
